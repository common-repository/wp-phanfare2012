== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I updated a caption on my Phanfare album, but WP-Phanfare is still showing the old caption. = 

WP-Phanfare uses SimplePie (http://simplepie.org/) to retrieve feeds.
The default duration is 3600 seconds, or 60 minutes.
Adjust the Cache duration in the Admin  Settings, WP-Phanfare panel

== Changelog ==

= future =
* Expose the cache directory location in the Settings panel
* Allow for customization of optional text at bottom of thumbnail display
* (harder, but possible) Preload lightbox slideshow with all Feed images, even if the User only chooses to display a few thumbnails
* Allow for customization of thumbnail size...

= 1.3.0 =
* Upgraded plugin for new Wordpress Plugin support model.

= 1.2.18 =
* Wow, embarrassing, I am still learning the proper use of svn

= 1.2.17 =
* Undo, last change, fixup order in readme.txt, trying to get new version to showup on wordpress plugin site

= 1.2.16 =
* PanelClass.php was not in the release, fixed.

= 1.2.15 =
* Still struggling to create a proper stable version w/o fprintf

= 1.2.14 =
* Bug Fix release:  syntax error in PanelClass.php

= 1.2.13 =
* No release,  superstitious

= 1.2.12 =
* Bug Fix release:  fixed problem with no fprintf() function in php4.  replaced with fwrite()

= 1.2.11 =
* Not released, working on new features, need more testing before releasing

= 1.2.10 = 
* Another oops! (Teaches me to do updates just before dinner!) Didn't handle older thumbsize option values properly

= 1.2.9 =
* Ooops! forgot to include the new OptionsClass.php file!

= 1.2.8 =
* Properly fixed problem with creation of cache directory.  Now relative to wordpress installation, should more gracefully handle not being able to create or write to the directory.
* Removed imagename caption, in Lightbox display (now shows untitled)
* Created a new thumbnail size L (179x119), the choices are Tiny, Small, Large
* Cleaned up the original code to NOT create multiple wp-phanfare options in wordpress DB.  Instead create a single multi-value option record.  This makes the code cleaner, removes database clutter, allows for easier expansion in the future.

= 1.2.7 =
* Fixed a problem reporting cache directory creation errors (on the actual display page)
* Noticed that the RSS feed was being sorted (by date of each entry "image"). Removed any sorting, so images will appear in "album" order.
* The Phanfare RSS feed seems to use the image filename "IMG_1234.jpg" when there is no other caption.  This clutters the display, so for now, when captions are desired, the plugin only displays non-image-filename captions.  (Meaning: If the caption matches "IMG_n+.jpg" or just ends with ".jpg" it is assumed to be a filename, and not displayed as a caption).
* Thanks to Jeff for letting me know about these problems
* I plan to roll out a version (in the future) with an updated Settings panel to allow more control of cache location, sorting of RSS feeds, and display of Image filenames in captions.

* Get the screen shots working (hopefully)

 - Added in the screenshots

= 1.0.0 =
